This course contains a lot of new information.

00:04.830 --> 00:11.400
So to make that information a bit easier to digest and remember I've included a PD f guide with the

00:11.400 --> 00:12.390
class.

00:12.420 --> 00:19.170
This is essentially a one hundred and twelve page e-book which contains a lecture notes code examples

00:19.170 --> 00:23.640
and documentation links for everything covered in the class.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.560
Video is my favorite way to learn something new but it's a poor reference tool.

00:28.560 --> 00:34.560
If you forget what something was called or where it was initially explained it can be really hard to

00:34.560 --> 00:40.710
dig through hours of video to find that the goal with the PD f guide is to give you that information

00:40.740 --> 00:47.200
in a way that scandal so you can easily find it and use it to do whatever you were trying to do.

00:47.220 --> 00:53.520
You can download the PDL guide as part of the lecture resources for this lesson so take a moment to

00:53.520 --> 00:57.150
download it crack it open and see what it's all about.

00:57.180 --> 01:00.080
All right that is it for this welcome s..

01:00.090 --> 01:02.550
Let's go ahead and jump right into the class.
