00:02.820 --> 00:09.100
Welcome to the class I'm Andrew and I'm excited to show you everything that no JSA can do.

00:09.150 --> 00:15.420
When I first started teaching note on udemy about five years ago no it was a super popular choice and

00:15.420 --> 00:19.230
that has not changed over the last five years.

00:19.230 --> 00:22.380
A ton of great new features have been added to node.

00:22.380 --> 00:29.910
It's only gotten more popular and more mature as a tool being used by professional developers everywhere.

00:29.910 --> 00:35.360
Now in this course we're going to cover everything you need to become a professional no developer.

00:35.460 --> 00:40.620
But in this video specifically there are three important things I want to talk about.

00:40.620 --> 00:43.290
First up we're going to talk about the curriculum.

00:43.290 --> 00:49.260
We'll talk about how we're going to go from where we are now to where we want to be which is a professional

00:49.280 --> 00:51.300
No j s developer.

00:51.300 --> 00:55.800
The second thing we're going to talk about is how you can get the most out of the class.

00:55.800 --> 01:01.950
And finally we'll talk about how you can get help if you get stuck or if you just have a question about

01:01.950 --> 01:03.980
something covered in the course.

01:03.990 --> 01:07.680
So let's go ahead and jump right in and talk about the course curriculum

01:11.130 --> 01:17.220
the curriculum for this class is broken into four major parts and in each part you end up building a

01:17.220 --> 01:23.670
brand new application by the end of the class you'll have built a Notes app that's part one a weather

01:23.670 --> 01:28.380
app for part 2 a task manager app for part 3.

01:28.410 --> 01:34.220
And finally we'll be wrapping up the course with a chat application for Part 4.

01:34.290 --> 01:39.680
Now with every new feature you learn you're actually going to integrate it into an application.

01:39.690 --> 01:43.020
So the goal is not just to learn features in isolation.

01:43.020 --> 01:48.870
The goal is to figure out how to combine these features together to build useful and interesting apps.

01:48.870 --> 01:55.050
My goal for you is that by the end of the class you can build useful and interesting apps on your own.

01:55.170 --> 02:00.690
At the end of the class I'll actually offer up some suggestions of what you could build based off of

02:00.690 --> 02:02.020
what you learned.

02:02.130 --> 02:06.080
Now the first app we're going to build together is the notes application.

02:06.150 --> 02:11.730
This is going to allow us to explore the very fundamentals of note so you'll learn how to create a note

02:11.730 --> 02:12.860
application.

02:12.900 --> 02:18.060
You'll learn how to load in the various features that node provides and you'll learn how to run your

02:18.060 --> 02:18.630
apps.

02:18.660 --> 02:24.360
Along the way we'll explore some interesting things that node can do such as reading and writing from

02:24.360 --> 02:25.920
the file system.

02:25.920 --> 02:31.770
Now once we have the basics down we're going to move on to the weather application which is a web app

02:32.040 --> 02:36.120
so the user will interact with that app via the browser.

02:36.130 --> 02:41.710
This application is going to require you to learn about creating your own no J.S. servers.

02:41.820 --> 02:49.080
Building your own API and communicating with third party services such as a service that allows you

02:49.080 --> 02:53.020
to fetch real time weather data for a given location.

02:53.160 --> 02:59.580
The app after that the task manager app comes with all of the features you would expect from an application.

02:59.610 --> 03:03.150
This includes authentication with an email and password.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.780
It includes real database storage and Mongo D.B..

03:06.810 --> 03:13.830
We're also going to cover useful features like file upload emails sending and more now of the last application

03:13.830 --> 03:16.570
you'll be building is a real time chat app.

03:16.710 --> 03:18.910
So you're going to learn how to use socket ie.

03:18.920 --> 03:24.690
Oh and web sockets to create real time applications for you and your users.

03:24.690 --> 03:27.110
Now that you know what you're getting yourself into.

03:27.330 --> 03:33.060
What I want to do is offer up a couple of suggestions as to how you can get the most out of the class

03:36.720 --> 03:42.300
this course was designed to be completely interactive so to get the most value out of the class you

03:42.330 --> 03:44.060
need to interact with it.

03:44.100 --> 03:50.150
Everything I do on my machine is something that you should be doing on your machine as well.

03:50.160 --> 03:55.560
So when we explore a new feature I'll be adding some code to one of our projects explaining what it

03:55.560 --> 03:57.300
does and then running it.

03:57.300 --> 04:02.220
You shouldn't be doing the same on your machine even though you're just watching what I'm doing and

04:02.220 --> 04:03.990
then doing it yourself.

04:03.990 --> 04:09.900
This is a bit of monkey see monkey do where you're just following along but it's really important in

04:09.900 --> 04:13.320
order to understand what a new feature does.

04:13.380 --> 04:19.530
Now when it comes to building up your problem solving abilities the monkey see monkey do approach doesn't

04:19.530 --> 04:20.270
work.

04:20.280 --> 04:27.690
That's why in this class I've included over 100 unique challenges requiring you to solve problems on

04:27.690 --> 04:30.910
your own using what's been covered in the course.

04:30.930 --> 04:34.300
So I'll set up the problem at telling you what I'd like you to do.

04:34.380 --> 04:39.580
I'll give you some time to go off and do it then together we'll work through the solution.

04:39.600 --> 04:45.010
It's really important that you do both of these follow along with the lessons and give the challenges

04:45.030 --> 04:51.270
an honest try that's going to make sure that when you're done the class you actually have these skills

04:51.330 --> 04:55.740
and experience to go off and build applications on your own.

04:55.740 --> 04:59.670
All right let's go ahead and talk about how you can get help should you need it.

05:03.310 --> 05:08.500
We're about to spend a lot of time together learning something new and it's likely that at some point

05:08.500 --> 05:11.180
in the class you're going to need a little help.

05:11.230 --> 05:12.950
Maybe you're running the program.

05:12.940 --> 05:16.400
We've been creating together and you're getting different results.

05:16.450 --> 05:23.110
Or maybe you try to run the program and it completely crashes printing some sort of cryptic error message

05:23.350 --> 05:25.330
regardless of what's going wrong.

05:25.420 --> 05:29.890
The course Q and A is your place to ask questions and get help.

05:29.890 --> 05:36.250
All that we ask is you provide as much information about your problem so we can help get you unstuck

05:36.430 --> 05:38.340
and back on track quickly.

05:38.350 --> 05:44.980
This includes a zip of your project code screenshots of errors or results that you weren't expecting

05:45.220 --> 05:50.050
and a description of what exactly you were doing when the problem occurred.

05:50.110 --> 05:56.050
Now throughout the class I'll also be teaching you how to debug your node J.S. applications and read

05:56.080 --> 05:57.880
those error messages.

05:57.880 --> 06:01.330
But the course Q and A is always there should you need it.

06:01.450 --> 06:02.010
All right.

06:02.020 --> 06:03.790
That is it for this video.

06:03.820 --> 06:06.280
Let's go ahead and continue on with the class.
